The WorkLog.jar file is recommended to place in its own folder, because it creates some files alongside it.

To install, just extract the WorkLog-folder from the archive to somewhere convenient.
When updating, replace the existing WorkLog.jar with the new one in from archive.

Just to be on the safe side, when updating, make a copy of the DB-folder before first launching the new version.
